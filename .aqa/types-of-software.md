## 4.6.1.2 Classification of software

There are two different types of software: System software and application software.

## System software
System software is comprised of the operating system, utility programs and drivers. It does all the tasks necessary for application software to run on top of it, such as networking, scheduling, and interfacing with the hardware. This allows application software to be compatible with many different systems.

## Application software
Application software is the everyday programs that are stored on the computer. This runs on top of the system software, and uses interfaces to the hardware defined by the system software. This allows application software to run on many different systems. For example, games send graphics commands to the graphics card through the system software.

There are three main types of application software:

- General purpose application software  
  Not written for any particular type of business, usable for many purposes. Examples of this include word processors and spreadsheet software.
- Special purpose application software  
  Software written for a defined purpose, a specific type of business. Examples of this include accountancy software.
- Bespoke application software  
  Software created for a company, for a specific task, where there is no existing software.
  

### General purpose application software

General purpose software is applicable for many different related tasks. This is sometimes called "generic software" as it suitable for many different companies and systems. It can be easily bought by consumers and companies, as it is available "off-the-shelf" in many stores.

For example:

- Word processing
- Spreadsheets
- Presentations

Pros:

- Cheap, as it is produced for many customers
- Reliable, as it has been used by many customers and thoroughly tested

Cons:

- It may not have all the features that every company requires
- It will take up a large amount of storage space, as it may have many features that are not required for the company
