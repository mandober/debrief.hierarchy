## Specification

### 4.6.1.3 System software
System software does several tasks required for operation of a computer, and perform secondary tasks seperate from applications on a computer.

This includes:

- Operating Systems - They hide the complexities of the hardware, and manages the programs on the computer
- Utility programs - They provide useful actions (e.g. defragmentation, screenshot capturing) to users
- Antiviruses - They protect computer systems from malicious software and attacks
- Libraries - They provide shared code to applications, to reduce code duplication (and therefore reduce required storage space) and make applications easier to create
- Programming software (e.g. compilers, interpreters, assemblers) - They allow other applications to be created using high-level languages
