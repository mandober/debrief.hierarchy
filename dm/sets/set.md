# Set

- Cardinality of the set X is denoted by $$|X| = n$$
- Cardinality of the powerset of the set X is $$|\mathcal{P}(X)| = 2^{|X|} = 2^n$$
- Cardinality of the Cartasian product of the set X: $$|X \times X| = |X^2| = n^2$$
- Cardinality of the powerset of the Cartasian product of the set X is $$|\mathcal{P}(X^2)| = 2^{(n^2)}$$
- Each relation is a subset of the Cartasian product of the set X: $$R \subseteq X^2$$
- Each relation is an element in the powerset of the Cartasian product of the set X: $$R \in P(X^2)$$
- Number of all possible relations on a $$X^2$$ set: $$|\mathcal{P}(X^2)| = 2^{(n^2)}$$
