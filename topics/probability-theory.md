**Probability theory** treats the concept of probability in a rigorous manner by expressing it with the set of axioms. Typically, these axioms formalize probability in terms of *probability space* which assigns *probability measure* (values from 0 to 1, inclusive) to a set of *outcomes* called the *sample space*. An *event* is any specified subset of these outcomes. 

Central subjects in probability theory include:
- discrete and continuous random variables
- probability distributions
- stochastic processes

*Stochastic processes* provide mathematical abstractions of non-deterministic or uncertain processes (or measured quantities) that may either be single occurrences (or evolve over time in a random fashion).

Although it is not possible to perfectly predict random events, much can be said about their behavior. Two major results in probability theory describing such behaviour are the **law of large numbers** and the **central limit theorem**.

As a mathematical foundation for statistics, probability theory is essential to many human activities that involve quantitative analysis of data.

Methods of probability theory also apply to descriptions of complex systems given only partial knowledge of their state, as in *statistical mechanics*.

A great discovery of twentieth-century physics was the probabilistic nature of physical phenomena at atomic scales, described in *quantum mechanics*.
