**Binominal name**: the first part of the name (the generic name) identifies the _genus_ to which the species belongs, while the second part (the specific name) identifies the _species_ within the genus.
For example, genus _Homo_, species _Homo sapiens_.


**Taxonomy** is the science of defining and naming groups of biological organisms on the basis of shared characteristics.

Organisms are grouped together into _taxa_ and these groups are given a _taxonomic rank_; groups of a given rank can be aggregated to form a _super-group_ of _higher rank_, thus creating a taxonomic hierarchy.

The principal ranks in modern use are domain, kingdom, phylum, class, order, family, genus and species (division is sometimes used in botany in place of phylum).

**Taxon** (plural taxa) is a group of one or more populations of organisms seen by taxonomists to form a unit. Although neither is required, a taxon is usually known by a particular name and given a particular ranking.
